#### Proposed Session Title ####
Enjoying the journey from Puppet 3.x to 4.x

#### Proposed Session Description ####
Puppet 4 has been out for a year and a half and you still have a Puppet 3 installation you need upgraded. We'll examine the benefits of upgrading and lay out a plan to make it happen. Many have been through the school of hard knocks, and we'll use that knowledge to make our own journey enjoyable.

This session will cover both Puppet FOSS and Enterprise editions.

#### Session Audience Level ####
Intermediate

#### What do you want the audience to gain from your session? ####
Attendees will gain a migration map with all the dragons, and the routes around them, clearly labeled so they can make their Puppet 3 to 4 migrations a reality.

I documented my Enterprise upgrade at https://rnelson0.com/2016/04/14/puppet-enterprise-migration-from-3-8-4-to-2015-3-3/ and have covered other details on the blog and twitter over the past year.
