# Blueprint
What's the high level plan to get from here to there.

* Start with Puppet 3.x
* Read the release notes
* Stairstep Roadmap
* Validate / Create rspec tests
* Refactor until your current version passes all the tests
* Snapshot and Upgrade the Master
* Upgrade the Agents
* Repeat the steps for each stairstep until you are get to 4.current


~~~SECTION:notes~~~
If you're on Puppet 2.x, you need to get to 3.x first! But that's not this talk. There were some good talks about this at PuppetConf 2015.
