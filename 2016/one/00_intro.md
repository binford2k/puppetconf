# What are we talking about today?
* Upgrade our Puppet master(s) and agents to Puppet 4.x
* Refactor our code base for Puppet 4, remove Puppet 2- and 3-isms.
* Not a linear progression, we may hit each step multiple times.

<!SLIDE center>
# Who does this apply to?
* Puppet Enterprise Users
* Puppet Opensource Users
* Masterful and Masterless setups

~~~SECTION:notes~~~
This is admittedly focused on a masterful setup, but if you have a masterless setup, a majority will still apply. We'll try and point it out as we go, and feel free to ask questions or point things out as we go.

# Why?
* Puppet 4 is new!
* Or: Puppet 3 is old! EOS on [December 31, 2016](https://puppet.com/misc/puppet-enterprise-lifecycle). When the last PE 3.x is EOS, Opensource will be EOS as well.
* Lots of new things in the Puppet 4 language (nee Future Parser) to take advantage of. Iteration, typed variables, etc.
* Application Orchestration!
* Modules are starting to only support Puppet 4. 
* Let Ruby 1.8.7 and Puppet w/Passenger go!
* Don't slow down the DevOps. Stairstep upgrades get harder and harder all the time. Stay current, it makes each upgrade minutes long instead of hours, days, or weeks.
~~~SECTION:notes~~~
Puppet 3 won't turn into a pumpkin on 1/1/2017, but you may find yourself stuck between a rock and a hard place when you need a newer version of a module that requires Puppet 4, probably because it is taking advantage of the language.

Puppetserver is the future and Ruby moves fast, take advantage of the AIO builds when possible.
